# OpensCadaver
The collection of 3d-models made by me in OpenSCAD.
´models´ contains openscad files written by me   
´ínclude´ contains files I've downloaded from the internet, which are used 
in some of my models. I included all necessary information about their 
creators in ´ínclude/README.md´
Some of the models may rely on latest features of OpenSCAD, so if 
something doesn't work, try using openscad-nightly.  
Generated STL files are not included in this repo, because I don't think 
they belong to github. Maybe this changes some time.
