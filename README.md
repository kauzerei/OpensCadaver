# OpensCadaver
The collection of 3d-models made by me in OpenSCAD.  
`models` contains openscad files written by me.  
`include` contains files I've downloaded from the internet, which are used
in some of my models. I included all necessary information about their
creators in ´ínclude/README.md´  
`stl` contains some generated STL files. They are not guaranteed to correspond to the state of .scad file, it's better to avoid then, and honestly I don't think they belong to git repo, being compiled from the source .scad files included.  
Some of the models may rely on latest features of OpenSCAD, so if
something doesn't work, try using openscad-nightly or build from master branch on github if you are hardcore.
